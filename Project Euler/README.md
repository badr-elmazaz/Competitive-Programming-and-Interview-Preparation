## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a collection of challenging computational problems meant to be solved with computer programs. The problems range from relatively simple to highly complex mathematical puzzles that require significant computational insight.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/badr-elmazaz/project-euler-solutions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired problem solution:

   ```
   cd problem-<number>/
   ```

3. Follow the specific instructions for each solution to understand or run the solution.

## Languages Used

While the primary language used for these solutions is Python, I'm also exploring problems in various other languages such as Java, C++, and Haskell. Each problem folder specifies the language used for that particular solution.


## Disclaimer

While these solutions are made available for learning and reference, I encourage everyone to attempt the problems on their own first. The joy and learning in problem-solving come from facing the challenges and finding a solution on your own.

Happy Coding! âœ¨

Remember, the purpose of these challenges is to learn and develop your computational problem-solving skills. Don't rush to solutions; the journey is equally (if not more) important than the destination!
