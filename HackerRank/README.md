Welcome to my repository of HackerRank solutions! This repository contains my personal solutions to various coding challenges found on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). The main goal of this repository is to document my journey through these challenges and to provide a reference for others who are working through similar problems.

## About Me

My HackerRank profile: [https://www.hackerrank.com/badrelmazaz](https://www.hackerrank.com/badrelmazaz)

## Repository Structure

Each solution in this repository is organized by the name of the problem. Here's a quick guide on how the repository is structured:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ "Topic/Problem Name"/
â”œâ”€â”€ Solutions/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ "Programming Language 1 (Python)"/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 1/
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md (Solution details)
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ 2 (more than one implementation)/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ "Programming Language 2 (Java)"/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ 1/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ main.java
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ README.md (Problem Description and Info)
```


The solutions are organized by programming language and then by implementation. Each implementation is numbered and contains a `main` file and a `README` file. The `main` file contains the solution code and the `README` file contains the problem description, solution details, and other relevant information. The folder number is used to indicate the order in which the solutions were implemented, the more recent solutions will have a higher number and they are the more efficient solutions than the previous ones.

## Usage
