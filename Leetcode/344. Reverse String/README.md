Difficulty: Easy

Status: Solved

## Description:

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)` extra memory.

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

Constraints:

-   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
-   `s[i]` is a [printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).
